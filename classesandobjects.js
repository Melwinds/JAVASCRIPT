// suppose i need another object as animal2 with bread as cat,name as perssian, age as 8, and sound as meow similar with method walking and talking in it. so we need to have four new varibles for cat and two new methods which is fine we can do it what if there are 100 objects need to be created it is possible but it makes the code bulky and reduces its readabilty so its not recommended to use classes without constructor

// Ther are three ways to do object cloning
// 1. using spread operator

//2. using assignment
